            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>For my Software Design Lab 1 project, we focused on the fundamentals of web development and version control. The task involved creating a simple that displayed "Hello, World!" in a web browser. This exercise introduced the structure of an HTML document and basic syntax. Additionally, we practiced using Git, where we learned essential commands such as initializing a repository, staging changes, committing updates, and pushing code to a remote repository like GitHub. This lab provided a hands-on introduction to software development workflows, reinforcing the importance of version control in collaborative coding environments.</p>
